# RoboCup 2019 ‚Äì Team Nirma Vidyavihar

## Overview  
This repository documents the design, development, and execution of our **task-specific robot** for the **Nirma National RoboCup 2019**, where we secured **All India Rank 3**. The competition was themed **"Govinda"**, requiring our robot to complete multiple dynamic challenges, including **removing obstacles (cardboard butter cubes), displacing a ball, and knocking down a "matki" (pot)**.

## Robot Functionality  
Our robot was designed **manually** perform the following tasks:

### üõë Obstacle Removal (Butter Cube Clearing)  
- Designed a **mechanized pushing arm** to **clear obstacles (cardboard butter cubes)** from the designated path.  
- Implemented **servo motors** for controlled extension and retraction of the arm.  

### ‚öΩ Ball Displacement  
- Developed a **motorized sweeping mechanism** to **push the ball out of the playing area**.  

### üè∫ Matki Knocking Mechanism  
- Engineered an **extendable striker arm** capable of reaching and **breaking the suspended "matki" (pot)**.  
- Ensured proper force calculation to break the pot without exceeding weight constraints.
